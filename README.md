# Sample React + .NET Core Application

This repository contains a minimal example of a React frontend and an ASP.NET Core backend. It demonstrates a simple authentication flow with login, logout and change password functionality using ASP.NET Core Identity.

## Structure

- `backend` – ASP.NET Core Web API with Identity and in-memory storage.
- `frontend` – React application with login and change password pages.

Both projects are intentionally lightweight so you can extend them for enterprise scenarios.
